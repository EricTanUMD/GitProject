This is the README File for the Final Project of Inst126
THis project aims to cover webscraping while also knocking out the checklist requirements for the semester. 

The idea for this project is to Use webscraping to get informations from Wikipedia into a CSV file and make it so the data can be sorted and catalogged. The user should be able to look into the statistics of this webpage https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue

Functionalities include being able to access the that scraped for the rankings, revenue numbers, revenue growth, employee numbers, and calculating the average revenue within a range inputed by the user. The first 4 function only requires the user to input a range between 1 and 100. The information that is scraped is already aranged by revenue so each place is based on that metric. Users are not allowed to input ranges outside the bounds or else the program will raise an error telling that. However, inputing ranges where the lower limt is somehow greater or equal to the upper limit is premptively fixed by altering the input beforehand to only encompass the upper limit. The user is given 3 chances to input valid inputs while using this program: the program exits after they expend their third try. Lastly, the user can exit the program at the end of each operation/option by typing no.

Users can have access to the csv file obtained from organizing the scraped data for their own purposes outside of this program as well.
